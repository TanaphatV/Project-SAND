PERFORMANCE TEST: ADD 4 SAND AT THE TOP CENTER, SimulateFrequency = 0.0001f
fps reduced to 48 within: 
Time: 56000 without exclude from draw
Time: 39000 with exclude from draw LMFAO
Time: 46000 with exclude from draw ver.2 LMFAO
Time:107000 by removing sand below when current sand stopped moving

1000 per batches
METHOD1 all batches : lower fps, but decreases slower
METHOD2 mixed : higher fps but decreases faster

100 per batch
seems to sustain high fps for longer a
